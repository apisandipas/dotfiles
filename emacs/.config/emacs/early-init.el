;;; early-init.el --- the earliest of init files  -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; This file runs early on in the initalization process.

;;; Code:

;; Increase the GC threshold for faster startup
;; The default is 800 kilobytes.  Measured in bytes.
(setq gc-cons-threshold (* 50 1000 1000))

;; Prefer loading newest compiled .el file
(setq load-prefer-newer noninteractive)

;; Native compilation settings
(when (featurep 'native-compile)
  ;; Silence compiler warnings as they can be pretty disruptive
  (setq native-comp-async-report-warnings-errors nil)

  ;; Make native compilation happens asynchronously
  (setq native-comp-deferred-compilation t)

  ;; Set the right directory to store the native compilation cache
  (setcar native-comp-eln-load-path

;; Don't use package.el, we'll use straight.el instead
(setq package-enable-at-startup nil)

;; Remove some unneeded UI elements (the user can turn back on anything they wish)
